Done with the height estimation

Had to code for a long time for this, ling time because of some inherent problems I couldn't figure out like <br>

  1)Why am i getting ore flight errors? Was it because EKF2 needed time to stabilise ? <br>
  2)Why dd i have to constantly kill processes to sto pit from launching with previous configuration<br>
  3)still do not understand the rtf factor, i am always off by three seconds <br>
  4)the detetion if it was in a circle had coinciding problems when they passed and the cylinders coincided <br>
  5) I will keep updating this with questions I get for tomorrow's class.<br>


note to self<br>
the documentation will be quite different this time including the errors i faced and how i resolved it, so i can use this as a reference for future px4 projects<br>
